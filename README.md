## Daily Learning Process

1. Each day, watch 90 minutes of the assigned courses listed above.
2. Solve all the JavaScript coding challenges provided by the GSG team.
3. Summarize your daily learning and document your challenge solutions on a separate readme page.
4. Repeat this process for the next 20 days, gradually advancing your JavaScript skills.
