# Day 3: Async javaScript & Promises 

## Asynchronous in JavaScript :
Asynchronous programming in JavaScript allows for non-blocking execution of tasks, improving performance and responsiveness by a range of asynchronous browser features :
- **Timers:** such as setTimeout and setInterval, enable executing code after a specified delay or at regular intervals.
  
- **AJAX:** (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) enables making HTTP requests to servers asynchronously, without blocking the main thread.
  
- **fetch:** The browser's fetch API simplifies making HTTP requests and handling responses asynchronously using Promises.

   ## Promises:
 - Promises are a programming pattern in JavaScript used for handling asynchronous operations.
